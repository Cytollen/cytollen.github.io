Welcome to my page! I'm a current a PhD student at [Purdue Industrial Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE) working with [Prof. Harsha Honnappa](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SSL/about). Previously, I obtained my BA in Physics from [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu) (working with [Prof. Darrell Schroeter](https://people.reed.edu/~schroetd/)) and my MS in Statistics from Purdue University.
